 *
 * The rw_lock class provides a mechanism to control access to a shared resource
 * by multiple readers and writers. Readers can acquire a shared (read) lock,
 * while writers can acquire an exclusive (write) lock. Multiple readers can
 * hold the shared lock simultaneously, but only one writer can hold the
 * exclusive lock at a time.
 *
 * The rw_lock class is non-copyable and non-assignable to prevent unintended
 * usage and potential issues with resource management.
